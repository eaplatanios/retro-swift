/// Trajectories consist of five main components, each of which can be a nested structure of
/// tensors with shapes whose first two dimensions are `[T, B]`, where `T` is the length of the
/// trajectory in terms of time steps and `B` is the batch size. The five components are:
///   - `stepKind`: Represents the kind of each time step (i.e., "first", "transition", or "last").
///     For example, if the agent takes an action in time step `t` that results in the current
///     episode ending, then `stepKind[t]` will be "last" and `stepKind[t + 1]` will be "first".
///   - `observation`: Observation that the agent receives from the environment in the beginning
///     of each time step.
///   - `action`: Action the agent took in each time step.
///   - `reward`: Reward that the agent received from the environment after each action. The reward
///     received after taking `action[t]` is `reward[t]`.
///   - `state`: The state of the agent after taking each action. The state the agent is in after
///     taking `action[t]` is `state[t]`.
